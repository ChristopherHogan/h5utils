h5utils 1.7 (3/9/02)

  * h5topng now supports multiple, user-definable color tables, a number
    of which are provided.  INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: the -c option now has
    the syntax: -c <colortable>.  The old behavior corresponds to the
    included "bluered" colortable, invoked via: -c bluered.

  * New -R option for h5topng to use a consistent color scale for
    all specified files.

  * New -0 option for h5topng and h5totxt that shifts the origin of the
    slice coordinates to the dataset center.

  * Added h5tovtk program to output VTK (Visualization ToolKit) data files.

  * Support -T (transpose dimensions) option in h5tov5d.

  * Fixed bug in h5topng that caused extra rows/columns of garbage pixels
    to be written at the edges of images when scaling was used.

  * When compiling the h5read Octave plugin, respect the CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS 
    environment variables.  Thanks to Max Colice for the bug report.

  * Fixed problem when --without-h5tov5d and --without-h5fromh4 are used. 
    Thanks to Nikola Ivanov Nikolov for the fix.

h5utils 1.6 (1/17/01)

  * Don't build h5fromh4 if the superior h4toh5 tool (from HDF5 1.4)
    is present.  Also added --{with,without}-h5fromh4 option to
    configure to force whether h5fromh4 is built.

h5utils 1.5.1 (12/9/00)

  * Support manually disabling Octave plugin support
    (configure --without-octave) in case of C++ problems.

  * Support Vis5d+ and Debian HDF header file locations.

h5utils 1.5 (7/9/00)

  * Added h5fromh4 program to convert HDF4 datasets to HDF5 format.

  * Added -S <s> option to h5topng as a shortcut for -X <s> -Y <s>.

h5utils 1.4 (5/28/00)

  * Added h5fromtxt program to convert text input to an HDF5 dataset.

h5utils 1.3.4 (1/31/00)

  * Improved -C contour plotting in h5topng.

  * Fix in h5topng man page (thanks to Christoph Becher).

h5utils 1.3.3 (1/30/00)

  * Bug fix in h5topng (would sometimes output solid black images).
    Thanks to Karl Koch for the bug report.

h5utils 1.3.2 (1/28/00)

  * Added h5topng -Z option to center color scale on zero.

  * Now support h5topng -C filename:dataset.

h5utils 1.3.1 (1/27/00)

  * Bug fixes in dataset name-handling, especially when using h5tov5d to
    join multiple datasets into one output file.

h5utils 1.3 (1/21/00)

  * You can now specify individual datasets within a file by using
    <filename>:<dataset> instead of just <filename> with h5topng,
    h5totxt, and h5tov5d.

h5utils 1.2.3: (1/20/00)

  * Fixed minor bug in 'h5totxt -h'.

h5utils 1.2.2: (1/12/00)

  * Makefile now includes CPPFLAGS in the compiler flags, making it
    easier to use header files in non-standard locations.  (CPPFLAGS
    is the proper place to put -I flags for the configure script.)

h5utils 1.2.1:  (1/1/00)

  * Modified -o option of h5tov5d to join datasets into a single Vis5d file.

h5utils 1.2:  (12/31/99)

  * Added h5tov5d program for converting to Vis5d format.

  * Improved installation; h5read.oct now goes into the sitewide Octave
    plugins directory, and things work correctly when only some of the
    utilities are compiled.

h5utils 1.1:  (12/6/99)

  * Added h5totxt program for exporting 2d slices of HDF5 files to text
    suitable for importing into a spreadsheet.

h5utils 1.0:  (11/22/99)

  * Initial release.
