.TH H5TOTXT 1 "March 9, 2002" "h5utils" "h5utils"
.SH NAME
h5totxt \- generate comma-delimited text from 2d slices of HDF5 files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B h5totxt
[\fIOPTION\fR]... [\fIHDF5FILE\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
." Add any additional description here
h5totxt is a utility to generate comma-delimited text (and similar
formats) from two-dimensional slices of numeric datasets in HDF5
files.  This way, the data can easily be imported into spreadsheets
and similar programs for analysis and visualization.

HDF5 is a free, portable binary format and supporting library developed
by the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University
of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign.  A single
.I h5
file can contain multiple data sets; by default,
.I h5totxt
takes the first dataset, but this can be changed via the
.B -d
option, or by using the syntax \fIHDF5FILE:DATASET\fR.

For a three-dimensional data set, the xy slice at z index zero is extracted
by default, but other slices can be extracted using the
.B -xyz
options.  The most basic usage is something like
\'h5totxt foo.h5\', which will output comma-delimited text to stdout
from the data in foo.h5.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -h
Display help on the command-line options and usage.
.TP
.B -V
Print the version number and copyright info for h5totxt.
.TP
.B -v
Verbose output.
.TP
\fB\-o\fR \fIfile\fR
Send text output to
.I file
rather than to stdout (the default).
.TP
\fB\-s\fR \fIsep\fR
Use the string
.I sep
to separate columns of the output rather than a comma (the default).
.TP
\fB\-x\fR \fIix\fR, \fB\-y\fR \fIiy\fR, \fB\-z\fR \fIiz\fR
This tells
.I h5totxt
to use a particular slice of a two- or three-dimensional dataset.  e.g.
.B -x
causes a yz plane to be used at an x index of
.I ix
(where the indices run from zero to one less than the maximum index in
that direction).  The default behaviour is equivalent to
.B -z
0.  See also the
.B -0
option to shift the origin of the slice coordinates to the dataset center.
.TP
.B -0
Shift the origin of the slice coordinates to the dataset center, so
that e.g. -0 -x 0 (or more compactly -0x0) returns the central x plane
of the dataset instead of the edge x plane.
.TP
.B -T
Transpose the data (interchange the image axes).  By default, no
transposition is done.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR \fIname\fR
Use dataset
.I name
from the input files; otherwise, the first dataset from each file is used.
Alternatively, use the syntax \fIHDF5FILE:DATASET\fR, which allows you
to specify a different dataset for each file.
You can use the
.I h5ls
command (included with hdf5) to find the names of datasets within a file.
