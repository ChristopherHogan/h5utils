<h1 align=center>h5utils</h1>

<p>This package contains a few utilities that I wrote for accessing
data in the HDF5 format developed by NCSA at the University of
Illinois.  You will need the HDF5 library, available from the <a
href="http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/">HDF home page</a>.

<a>The author of this package is Steven G. Johnson (<a
href="mailto:stevenj@alum.mit.edu">stevenj@alum.mit.edu</a>).

<p>To compile and install the package, just type the usual:

<pre>
./configure
make
make install
</pre>

<p>You can use <code>make uninstall</code> to get rid of all the
installed files.

<p>Note that you need to have certain prerequisites, like the PNG and
zlib libraries and/or GNU Octave, in order to compile all of the
utilities, as described below.  If you don't have these, then only
some of the utilities will be compiled.

<p>The utilities are:

<h2>h5topng</h2>

<p>This is a program to extract a two-dimensional slice from an HDF5
dataset and export it as an image in PNG format.  It is designed for
quick-and-dirty examination of data, and for batch-processing of data
on the command-line.  However, it does support niceties like scaling,
skewing, superimposing contours from another file, and a couple of
different color maps.

PNG is a free image format, and is a recommendation of the World Wide
Web Consortium.  You will need to get the free libpng library if you
don't have it already.  libpng and lots of other stuff can be found at
the <a href="http://www.cdrom.com/pub/png">PNG home page</a>.

<p>You will also need zlib (libz) if you don't already have it, for
image compression (see the <a href="http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/zlib/">zlib Home Page</a>).

<p>The <code>h5topng</code> source code includes the files
<code>writepng.c</code> and <code>writepng.h</code>, which provide
self-contained subroutines for writing out a PNG image from a
two-dimensional array of floating-point values.  You might find this
useful if you want to directly output images from your own scientific
programs.

<p><code>h5topng</code> includes a man page; you can also run
<code>h5topng -h</code> for a terse listing of options.

<h2>h5totxt</h2>

<p>This program outputs 2d slices of HDF5 files as ASCII text in
comma-delimited format, suitable for importing into a spreadsheet.
(You can use a different delimiter with the <code>-s</code> option.)
Run <code>h5totxt -h</code> for a terse listing of its options; there
is also a man page.

<h2>h5fromtxt</h2>

<p>In some sense the inverse of <code>h5totxt</code>, this program
takes text input and outputs a multi-dimensional numeric dataset in an
HDF5 file.  The input numbers can be delimited by arbitrary
characters, and it can automatically guess the dimensions of one- and
two-dimensional input.  Multi-dimensional datasets can also be written
by specifying their dimensions explicitly.  Run <code>h5fromtxt
-h</code> for a terse listing of its options; there is also a man
page.

<h2>h5fromh4</h2>

<p>The <code>h5fromh4</code> program takes a file in the old <a
href="http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/hdf4.html">HDF4</a> format and converts
the dataset contained therein to an HDF5 file.  (Currently, only a
single dataset per HDF4 file is supported.  The HDF5 developers are
supposedly working on a more general conversion utility.)

<p>The HDF4 libraries need to be installed on your system for this
program to be compiled and installed (otherwise it will be skipped).

<h2>h5tov5d</h2>

<p><code>h5tov5d</code> is a program to convert multidimensional HDF5
datasets to "v5d" files, the format used by Vis5d.  <a
href="http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~billh/vis5d.html">Vis5d</a> is a free
volumetric visualization program for looking at 3, 4, or even
5-dimensional datasets.  It allows you to view slices, isosurfaces,
volume renderings, contours, and much more.  (4 and 5 dimensional
datasets are rendered via time-series animation and multiple
"variables.")  Being based on <a
href="http://www.opengl.org/">OpenGL</a>, Vis5d also lets you rotate
and manipulate its graphs in real time.

<p>In order to compile <code>h5tov5d</code>, you need to first
download and compile Vis5d (available from the <a
href="http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~billh/vis5d.html">Vis5d Home
Page</a>).  It is <em>not</em> sufficient to download the precompiled
binaries, as they don't include the necessary object files for writing
the v5d data format.  Then, when configuring h5utils, you should use:

<pre>
./configure --with-v5d=<i>dir</i>
</pre>

<p>Here, <code><i>dir</i></code> should be the path of the Vis5d
source directory which you downloaded and compiled.  Once you have
successfully compiled <code>h5tov5d</code>, you may delete the Vis5d
source directory if you wish.

<p>Alternatively, you can download my <a
href="http://ab-initio.mit.edu/mpb/hdf.html#vis5d">Vis5D 5.2a</a>
package, which installs the relevant Vis5d routines as shared
libraries.  In this case, you won't need to specify
<code>--with-v5d</code>.

<p>See the <code>h5tov5d</code> man page for usage instructions, or
run <code>h5tov5d -h</code> for a terse listing of options.

<h2>h5read.oct</h2>

<p>This is an Octave plug-in for importing 2d slices from HDF5
datasets into Octave, where you can then manipulate and plot the data.
GNU Octave is a free Matlab-like data analysis and numerical computing
tool; you can download it or find more about it at the <a
href="http://www.che.wisc.edu/octave/">Octave home page</a>.

<p>You will need to have Octave already installed in order to compile
this.  Once it is compiled, <code>make install</code> places
<code>h5read.oct</code> in the global site directory for Octave
plugins (<code><i>OCTAVE_HOME</i>/libexec/octave/site/oct/<i>ARCH</i>/</code>).

<p>In Octave, type <code>help h5read</code> for instructions.

<h2>arrayh5</h2>

<p>The files <code>arrayh5.c</code> and <code>arrayh5.h</code> define
some data structures and utilities to let you grab multi-dimensional
datasets (or slices thereof) from HDF5 files using a simplified
interface.  You might find it useful in your own programs, or just to
help you learn how to use HDF5.
