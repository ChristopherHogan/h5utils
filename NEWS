h5utils 1.2.2: (1/12/00)

  * Makefile now includes CPPFLAGS in the compiler flags, making it
    easier to use header files in non-standard locations.  (CPPFLAGS
    is the proper place to put -I flags for the configure script.)

h5utils 1.2.1:  (1/1/00)

  * Modified -o option of h5tov5d to join datasets into a single Vis5d file.

h5utils 1.2:  (12/31/99)

  * Added h5tov5d program for converting to Vis5d format.

  * Improved installation; h5read.oct now goes into the sitewide Octave
    plugins directory, and things work correctly when only some of the
    utilities are compiled.

h5utils 1.1:  (12/6/99)

  * Added h5totxt program for exporting 2d slices of HDF5 files to text
    suitable for importing into a spreadsheet.

h5utils 1.0:  (11/22/99)

  * Initial release.
