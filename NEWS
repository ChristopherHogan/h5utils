h5utils 1.3.2 (1/28/00)

  * Added h5topng -Z option to center color scale on zero.

  * Now support h5topng -C filename:dataset.

h5utils 1.3.1 (1/27/00)

  * Bug fixes in dataset name-handling, especially when using h5tov5d to
    join multiple datasets into one output file.

h5utils 1.3 (1/21/00)

  * You can now specify individual datasets within a file by using
    <filename>:<dataset> instead of just <filename> with h5topng,
    h5totxt, and h5tov5d.

h5utils 1.2.3: (1/20/00)

  * Fixed minor bug in 'h5totxt -h'.

h5utils 1.2.2: (1/12/00)

  * Makefile now includes CPPFLAGS in the compiler flags, making it
    easier to use header files in non-standard locations.  (CPPFLAGS
    is the proper place to put -I flags for the configure script.)

h5utils 1.2.1:  (1/1/00)

  * Modified -o option of h5tov5d to join datasets into a single Vis5d file.

h5utils 1.2:  (12/31/99)

  * Added h5tov5d program for converting to Vis5d format.

  * Improved installation; h5read.oct now goes into the sitewide Octave
    plugins directory, and things work correctly when only some of the
    utilities are compiled.

h5utils 1.1:  (12/6/99)

  * Added h5totxt program for exporting 2d slices of HDF5 files to text
    suitable for importing into a spreadsheet.

h5utils 1.0:  (11/22/99)

  * Initial release.
