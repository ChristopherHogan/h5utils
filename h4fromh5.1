.TH H4FROMH5 1 "September 2, 2005" "h5utils" "h5utils"
.SH NAME
h4fromh5 \- convert HDF5 scientific dataset to an HDF4 file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B h4fromh5
[\fIOPTION\fR]... [\fIHDF4FILE\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
." Add any additional description here
h4fromh5 takes one or more files in HDF5 format and outputs files in
HDF4 format containing the datasets from the HDF5 files.  (Currently,
only a single dataset per HDF5 file is converted.)

HDF4 and HDF5 are free, portable binary formats and supporting libraries
developed by the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at
the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign.

 A single
.I h5
file can contain multiple data sets; by default,
.I h4fromh5
converts the first dataset, but this can be changed via the
.B -d
option, or by using the syntax \fIHDF5FILE:DATASET\fR.

The most basic usage is something like \'h4fromh5 foo.h5\', which
will output a file foo.hdf containing the scientific dataset from
foo.h5.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -h
Display help on the command-line options and usage.
.TP
.B -V
Print the version number and copyright info for h4fromh5.
.TP
.B -v
Verbose output.
.TP
.B -T
Transpose the output dataset (e.g. LxMxN becomes NxMxL).  This is often
useful because HDF5 programs typically follow C (row-major) conventions
while HDF4 programs often follow Fortran (column-major, transposed)
conventions for array ordering.
.TP
\fB\-o\fR \fIfile\fR
Send HDF output to
.I file
rather than to the input filename with .h5 replaced with .hdf (the
default).
.TP
\fB\-d\fR \fIname\fR
Read from dataset
.I name
in the input; otherwise, the first dataset in the input file is used.
Alternatively, use the syntax \fIHDF5FILE:DATASET\fR when the
input file names are specified.
.SH BUGS
Send bug reports to S. G. Johnson, stevenj@alum.mit.edu.
