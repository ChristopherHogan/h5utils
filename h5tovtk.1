.SH NAME
h5tovtk \- convert datasets in HDF5 files to VTK format
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B h5tovtk
[\fIOPTION\fR]... [\fIHDF5FILE\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
." Add any additional description here
h5tovtk is a program to generate VTK data files from multidimensional
datasets in HDF5 files.  VTK, the Visualization ToolKit, is an open
source, freely available software system for 3D computer graphics,
image processing, and visualization.  VTK itself is a programming
library, but it is also the basis for a number of end-user graphical
visualization programs.

HDF5 is a free, portable binary format and supporting library developed
by the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University
of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign.  A single
.I h5
file can contain multiple datasets; by default,
.I h5tovtk
takes the first dataset, but this can be changed via the
.B -d
option, or by using the syntax \fIHDF5FILE:DATASET\fR.

1d/2d/3d datasets are converted into 3d VTK \"structured points\"
datasets.

A typical invocation is of the form
\'h5tovtk foo.h5\', which will output a VTK data file foo.vtk
from the data in foo.h5.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -h
Display help on the command-line options and usage.
.TP
.B -V
Print the version number and copyright info for h5tovtk.
.TP
.B -v
Verbose output.
.TP
\fB\-o\fR \fIfile\fR
Save the datasets from all of the input files to a single VTK
.I file
with each dataset being expressed as a separate VTK scalar variable.

Otherwise, the default behavior is to save each dataset to a separate
VTK file, with the .h5 suffix of the input filename replaced by .vtk
in the output filename.
.TP
\fB\-1\fR, \fB\-2\fR, \fB\-4\fR
Use 1 , 2, or 4 bytes to store each data point in the
output file.  Fewer bytes will cause VTK to be faster (as well as
requiring less storage and memory), but will decrease the resolution
in the values.
.B -1
will break up the data values into one of 256 possible values (on a
linear scale from the minimum to the maximum value in your data),
.B -2
will allow 65536 possible values, and
.B -4
will use 4-byte floating-point numbers for an "exact" representation.
In most circumstances,
.B -1
is more than adequate for data visualization purposes.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR \fIname\fR
Use dataset
.I name
from the input files; otherwise, the first dataset from each file is used.
Alternatively, use the syntax \fIHDF5FILE:DATASET\fR, which allows you
to specify a different dataset for each file.
You can use the
.I h5ls
command (included with hdf5) to find the names of datasets within a file.
.SH BUGS
