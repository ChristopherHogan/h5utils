<h1>h5utils</h1>

<p>This package contains a few utilities that I wrote for accessing
data in the HDF5 format developed by NCSA at the University of
Illinois.  You will need the HDF5 library, available from the <a
href="http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/">HDF home page</a>.

<a>The author of this package is Steven G. Johnson (<a
href="mailto:stevenj@alum.mit.edu">stevenj@alum.mit.edu</a>).

<p>To compile and install the package, just type the usual:

<pre>
./configure
make
make install
</pre>

<p>Note that you need to have certain prerequisites, like the PNG and
zlib libraries, and/or GNU Octave, in order to compile all of the
utilities, as described below.

<p>The utilities include:

<h2>h5topng</h2>

<p>This is a program to extract a two-dimensional slice from an HDF5
dataset and export it as an image in PNG format.  It is designed for
quick-and-dirty examination of data, and for batch-processing of data
on the command-line.  However, it does support niceties like scaling,
skewing, superimposing contours from another file, and a couple of
different color maps.

PNG is a free image format, and is a recommendation of the World Wide
Web Consortium.  You will need to get the free libpng library if you
don't have it already.  libpng and lots of other stuff can be found at
the <a href="http://www.cdrom.com/pub/png">PNG home page</a>.

<p>You will also need zlib (libz) if you don't already have it, for
image compression (see the <a href="http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/zlib/">zlib Home Page</a>).

<p>The <code>h5topng</code> source code includes the files
<code>writepng.c</code> and <code>writepng.h</code>, which provide
self-contained subroutines for writing out a PNG image from a
two-dimensional array of floating-point values.  You might find this
useful if you want to directly output images from your own scientific
programs.

<p><code>h5topng</code> includes a man page; you can also run
<code>h5topng -h</code> for a terse listing of options.

<h2>h5totxt</h2>

<p>This program outputs 2d slices of HDF5 files as ASCII text in
comma-delimited format, suitable for importing into a spreadsheet.
(You can use a different delimiter with the <code>-s</code> option.)
Run <code>h5totxt -h</code> for a terse listing of its options; there
is also a man page.

<h2>h5read.oct</h2>

<p>This is an Octave plug-in for importing 2d slices from HDF5
datasets into Octave, where you can then manipulate and plot the data.
GNU Octave is a free Matlab-like data analysis and numerical computing
tool; you can download it or find more about it at the <a
href="http://www.che.wisc.edu/octave/">Octave home page</a>.

<p>You will need to have Octave already installed in order to compile
this.  Once it is installed, you can either place
<code>h5read.oct</code> with the other <code>.oct</code> files that
came with Octave, or you can just leave it in the directory you run
octave from.

<p>In Octave, type <code>help h5read</code> for instructions.

<h2>arrayh5</h2>

<p>The files <code>arrayh5.c</code> and <code>arrayh5.h</code> define
some data structures and utilities to let you grab multi-dimensional
datasets (or slices thereof) from HDF5 files using a simplified
interface.  You might find it useful in your own programs, or just to
help you learn how to use HDF5.
